# QGISExportToPDF
Export layouts in QGIS to pdf.  This is no GUI version that can be run on a server.  Windows and Ubuntu versions available in this repository.

This code is specifically used to export maps to PDF format on my website https://firealertmap.com. (https://github.com/luckydsf/firealertmap)
